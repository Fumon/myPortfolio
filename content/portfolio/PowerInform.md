description: "Winner of the MaRS Future Impact Award at the MaRS Energy Hackathon in 2013. Our team designed a testing and validation framework as well as an assistive library for the Greenbutton ConnectMyData Standard. My contribution was in software architecture and standards implementation. Afterwards, I co-founded PowerInform inc. to write power company implementations of the standard with millions of users and assist innovative companies with bringing their implementations up to spec to securely access customer data for green-energy saving and power usage monitoring."
