description: "A project started to assist the family members and Personal Service Workers of people with dementia, GoodRobot developed a prototype home monitoring system to collect health measurements and track door and lighting activity remotely. I developed the hardware hub, custom firmware and drivers for collecting measurements and hactivity from a variety of different protocols (Bluetooth, RF, ANT wireless, Insteon, X10).
Additionally, I developed the data collection and operations backend which featured secure VPN device administration, automated unique firmware generation, as well as alerts and reporting."
