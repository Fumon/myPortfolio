description: "My long running pet project to reverse engineer and drive an ancient electromechanical display culminating in a reusable PCB controller and playable games of Snake as well as displays of Conway's Game of Life running on an embedded microcontroller and using a laser cut, custom joystick.
Later projects included a large, wall mounted display with multi-player tetris and snake, a large clock display and many other collaborative projects."
