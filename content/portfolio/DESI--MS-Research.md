description: "Variations in the Abundance of Lipid Biomarker Ions in Mass Spectrometry Images Correlate to Tissue Density: A cross-institutional research paper where my contribution was a novel, multi-modal optical+mass spectrometry image analysis technique to compare several explanations and ultimately put forth my own explanation for heterogeneous mass spectrometry imaging signals in known homogeneous tumor samples. The results were published in Analytical Chemistry. For my work, the research group decided to put forth my name as first author for which I am extremely honored. Later, this paper won the 2017 Gird Binnig Poster Choice award at the Definiens Symposium in Amsterdam."
