description: "Since 2009, I have participated in the 3D printing community as a hardware and software developer. I have worked with several pioneering printers, discovering hardware and firmware flaws and submitting patches on such models as the original Makerbot Cupcake CNC and Ultimaker 1 and several software projects such as Printrun, Marlin and Slic3r."
