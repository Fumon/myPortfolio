description: "As part of the Ken Spencer Science park project Urban Visuals was commissioned to design and create bicycle counters for a busy seawall cycling route that passes by the Science Centre in Vancouver. I developed the internal hardware, control system and software backend to collect and display counts and custom messages. My solution included an embedded configuration webserver, secure updates via VPN, and an arduino all running on a consumer router with a custom Linux distribution. The robust software design allowed remote recovery from several independent hardware failures during operation and the system continues to operate after 5+ years."
