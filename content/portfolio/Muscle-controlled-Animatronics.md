description: "A project to create a set of animatronic ears which express in-step with the user's eyebrow and ear muscles. With a lot of help, I developed a prototype using a homebrewed Electromyography amplifier using coat buttons for electrodes, and an embedded embedded signal processing board to analyze the data and control servos in response to muscle pulses."
